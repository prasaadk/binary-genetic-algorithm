# Basic Binary Genetic Algorithm in Clojure

This exercise is based upon a very elegant explanation of Genetic Algorithms [here](http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/creating-a-genetic-algorithm-for-beginners/3).

I have re-implemented it in Clojure, while original solution is in Java.

## Basic Process

1. Create a random population
2. Check if any one individual meets the fitness requirement
3. If not, let the next generation evolve from the previous one
4. Evolution simulates crossover i.e reproduction and random gene mutation
5. The genes of the fittest individual often survives via reproduction and helps further generations to reach the goal.
6. This process is repeated until the fitness requirement is met.
